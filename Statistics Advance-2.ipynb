    "### Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Mass Function (PMF):**\n",
    "- The PMF is a function that gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. It is used for discrete random variables.\n",
    "- **Example:** Suppose we roll a fair six-sided die. The PMF of this experiment assigns a probability to each outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), which is \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\) for each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probability Density Function (PDF):**\n",
    "- The PDF is a function that describes the likelihood of a continuous random variable to take on a particular value. The probability of the variable falling within a particular range is given by the area under the curve of the PDF within that range.\n",
    "- **Example:** For a standard normal distribution (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1), the PDF is given by the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{x^2}{2}} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why is CDF used?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cumulative Density Function (CDF):**\n",
    "- The CDF of a random variable \\( X \\) is a function that gives the probability that \\( X \\) will take a value less than or equal to \\( x \\). It is used for both discrete and continuous random variables.\n",
    "- **Example:** If \\( X \\) is the outcome of rolling a fair six-sided die, the CDF at \\( x = 3 \\) is the probability that the outcome is less than or equal to 3, which is \\( P(X \\leq 3) = \\frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why CDF is used:**\n",
    "- The CDF provides a complete description of the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "- It is useful for calculating probabilities over intervals and for understanding the distribution's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples of Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "- Heights of people in a population.\n",
    "- Test scores in a large exam.\n",
    "- Measurement errors in scientific experiments.\n",
    "- Daily returns of a stock in finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters and Shape:**\n",
    "- **Mean (\\(\\mu\\))**: Determines the center of the distribution.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\))**: Determines the spread or width of the distribution.\n",
    "  - A larger \\(\\sigma\\) results in a wider and flatter distribution.\n",
    "  - A smaller \\(\\sigma\\) results in a narrower and taller distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4: Explain the importance of Normal Distribution. Give a few real-life examples of Normal Distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance of Normal Distribution:**\n",
    "- Many statistical methods and tests assume normality due to its mathematical properties.\n",
    "- The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of sample means approaches a normal distribution as the sample size increases, regardless of the population's distribution.\n",
    "- It is widely used in inferential statistics to make predictions and decisions based on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-life Examples:**\n",
    "- Heights of adult men and women.\n",
    "- IQ scores.\n",
    "- Blood pressure measurements.\n",
    "- Measurement errors in physical experiments.\n",
    "- Stock returns in financial markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bernoulli Distribution:**\n",
    "- A Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution for a random variable which takes the value 1 with probability \\( p \\) and the value 0 with probability \\( 1-p \\).\n",
    "- **Example:** Flipping a coin, where 1 represents heads and 0 represents tails, with \\( p = 0.5 \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution:**\n",
    "- **Bernoulli Distribution:** Represents a single trial with two possible outcomes (success or failure).\n",
    "- **Binomial Distribution:** Represents the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials with the same probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6: Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given:\n",
    "- Mean (\\(\\mu\\)) = 50\n",
    "- Standard Deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)) = 10\n",
    "- Value (\\(X\\)) = 60\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation:**\n",
    "1. Convert the value to a z-score:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma} = \\frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the standard normal distribution to find the probability:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(Z > 1)\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Look up the z-score in standard normal distribution tables or use a calculator to find:\n",
    "   \\[\n",
    "   P(Z > 1) \\approx 0.1587\n",
    "   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60 is approximately 0.1587 or 15.87%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7: Explain Uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Uniform Distribution:**\n",
    "- A uniform distribution is a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. Each value in a finite set of possible values has an equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Rolling a fair six-sided die. Each outcome (1 through 6) has an equal probability of \\( \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8: What is the z-score? State the importance of the z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Z-score:**\n",
    "- The z-score is a measure of how many standard deviations an element is from the mean of the distribution. It is calculated as:\n",
    "  \\[\n",
    "  z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}\n",
    "  \\]\n",
    "  where \\( X \\) is the value, \\( \\mu \\) is the mean, and \\( \\sigma \\) is the standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance of the Z-score:**\n",
    "- Standardizes different datasets for comparison.\n",
    "- Identifies outliers.\n",
    "- Calculates probabilities and percentiles in a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q9: What is Central Limit Theorem? State the significance of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Central Limit Theorem (CLT):**\n",
    "- The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as the sample size becomes larger, regardless of the population's distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance of CLT:**\n",
    "- Allows us to use normal distribution techniques for inference even if the data is not normally distributed, given a sufficiently large sample size.\n",
    "- Justifies the use of sample means for hypothesis testing and confidence intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q10: State the assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions of CLT:**\n",
    "1. The samples must be independent of each other.\n",
    "2. The sample size should be sufficiently large (commonly \\( n > 30 \\)).\n",
    "3. The population from which the samples are drawn should have a finite variance.\n"
